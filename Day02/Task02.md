1. Use a `<table>` to display the list of students.
2. Show the following details for each student:
   - **ID**
   - **Name**
   - **Email**
3. Use `*ngFor` to iterate over the `students` array and populate the table rows dynamically.

#### **Task 2: Add New Student**
1. Create a form for adding a new student with the following input fields:
   - **ID** (number)
   - **Name** (text)
   - **Email** (text)
2. Bind the input fields to a `newStudent` object using `ngModel`.
3. Add a **Submit** button that calls the `addStudent()` method when clicked.

   - All fields are required.
   - A new student is added to the `students` list only when all fields are filled.

#### **Task 3: Reset Form After Adding**
